Hello! This is the repository for my third portfolio piece, "Data Analysis Report on Dogs' Height and Weight," for Dr. Wiernik's Programming with Data Course. 

## Data Source: The dataset I will be using for this project is "AKC_Breed_Info." This data came from data.world, was published by "len fishman" and the link to the data is: https://data.world/len/dog-canine-breed-size-akc 

  #### The description of this dataset is: "This dataset include breed size data for dogs from the American Kennel Club (AKC)."

## Analysis: For this data analysis project, I will be exploring the relationships between dogs' height and weight using plots, Chi-squares, and an ANOVA.
