# Portfolio Piece 3 - Data Analysis Report on Dogs' Height and Weight

Hello! This is the repository for my third portfolio piece, "Data Analysis Report on Dogs' Height and Weight," for Dr. Wiernik's Programming with Data Course. 

## Data Source: The dataset I will be using for this project is "drug-use-by-age" from the FiveThirtyEight datasets. This data was sourced by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive. The data can be found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/drug-use-by-age 

#### Dataset description: This dataset covers usage of 13 different drugs across 17 age groups. For each drug, there is information about the "use," which is the percentage of those in an age group that have used that drug in the last 12 months, and "frequency," which is the median number of times a user in that age group used that drug in the past 12 months. 


## Research Plan: 
#### For this data analysis report, I wanted to examine the usage of three drugs: alcohol, marijuana, and hallucinogens. My rationale for choosing these drugs is that I expect the perceptions of each drug to vary across age. Alcohol is the most common drug in the US, and views on marijuana and hallucinogens have been changing in recent years as their therapeutic benefits are being recognized, with laws reflecting this through their legalization or decriminalization. With these three variables, I want to examine trends in both use and frequency across age groups. 
##### Hypotheses: 
1. Alcohol use will not significantly differ with age, but frequency will significantly differ by age. 
2. Marijuana use will be significantly different by age, but frequency will not significantly differ by age. 
3. Hallucinogen use will be significantly different by age, but frequency will not signficantly differ by age. 

#### Through working on analyses, I struggled to test these relationships despite many hours of attempts. In the end, I changed my research plan to instead examine if use (percentage of people who have used a substance in the past 12 months) and frequency (median number of times that substance was used in the past 12 months) are correlated for alcohol, marijuana, and hallucinogens, to provide insight into addiction or dependance on a substance. 
#### New hypotheses:
1. Alcohol use and frequency will be correlated.
2. Marijuana use and frequency will be correlated. 
3. Hallucinogen use and frequency will NOT be correlated.


## *Folders*
### Data: This folder is where the data for the project is stored: "drug-use-by-age.csv"
  #### Codebook: This subfolder contains a codebook that explains the data and the variables within it. 
### Cleaning & Analysis: This folder is for the code for cleaning, filtering, and analyzing the data. 
### Failed Attempts: This folder contains my many failed attempts at working on data analysis reports using different datsets. I am keeping them here because there are some interesting and useful functions in the code, but this folder is not relevant to the project.
